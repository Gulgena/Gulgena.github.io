## My Interests

Hi! 👋 I'm Gulgena, a dedicated cybersecurity student with a deep interest in ethical hacking, network security, and digital forensics. I love learning how to uncover vulnerabilities and protect systems from cyber threats.

Beyond academics, I enjoy:
- Solving Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges 🕵️‍♀️
- Exploring new technologies and tools
- Reading cybersecurity blogs and articles
- Practicing Java and automation skills I developed from my SDET bootcamp in 2022

I'm currently looking for internship opportunities where I can apply my skills and grow professionally in the field of cybersecurity.
